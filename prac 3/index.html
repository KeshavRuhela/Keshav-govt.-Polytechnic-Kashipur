                    CSE, study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and
                    use of
                    computers—devices that automatically process information. Computer science traces its roots to work
                    done
                    by English mathematician Charles Babbage, who first proposed a programmable mechanical calculator in
                    1837. Until the advent of electronic digital computers in the 1940s, computer science was not
                    generally
                    distinguished as being separate from mathematics and engineering. Since then it has sprouted
                    numerous
                    branches of research that are unique to the discipline.csl

                    Early work in the field of computer science during the late 1940s and early 1950s focused on
                    automating
                    the process of making calculations for use in science and engineering. Scientists and engineers
                    developed theoretical models of computation that enabled them to analyze how efficient different
                    approaches were in performing various calculations. Computer science overlapped considerably during
                    this
                    time with the branch of mathematics known as numerical analysis, which examines the accuracy and
                    precision of calculations.

                <p style="margin: 10px;">
                    Computer scientists continue to expand the frontiers of computer and information systems by
                    pioneering
                    the designs of more complex, reliable, and powerful computers; enabling networks of computers to
                    efficiently exchange vast amounts of information; and seeking ways to make computers behave
                    intelligently. As computers become an increasingly integral part of modern society, computer
                    scientists
                    strive to solve new problems and invent better methods of solving current problems.

                    Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction

                    Civil engineering is the oldest engineering discipline after military engineering, and it was
                    defined to
                    distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering. It is traditionally broken into
                    several
                    sub-disciplines including environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural
                    engineering,

                <p style="margin: 15px;">
                Engineers in this field design, test, build, and operate machinery of all types; they also work on a
                variety of manufactured goods and certain kinds of structures.
</p><p style="margin: 15px;">
                The field is divided into :
</p><p style="margin: 15px;">
                (1) machinery, mechanisms, materials, hydraulics, and pneumatics; and
</p><p style="margin: 15px;">
                (2) heat as applied to engines, work and energy, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning.
</p><p style="margin: 15px;">
                The mechanical engineer, therefore, must be trained in mechanics, hydraulics, and thermodynamics and
                must be fully grounded in such subjects as metallurgy and machine design. Some mechanical engineers
                specialize in particular types of machines such as pumps or steam turbines. A mechanical engineer
                designs not only the machines that make products but the products themselves, and must design for both
                economy and efficiency. A typical example of the complexity of modern mechanical engineering is the
                design of an automobile, which entails not only the design of the engine that drives the car but also
                all its attendant accessories such as the steering and braking systems, the lighting system, the gearing
                by which the engine’s power is delivered to the wheels, the controls, and the body, including such
                details as the door latches and the type of seat upholstery.

                MECHANICAL LAB
                </p><p style="margin: 15px;">Thermal lab:- Thermal lab is based on heat transformation.Here mainly the energy of boiled water is used
                to perform different tasks.Here we learn about various uses of thermal energy which are specificlly used
                in industries so that a good use of energy can be done.Various machines and equipments are avilable for
                studets to understand practically that how thermal energy can be used for its best efficiency in thermal
                lab.Some of the equipments of thermal lab are as:
</p><p style="margin: 15px;">
                Equipment:-Babcock and Wilcox box,Refrigeration and aircondition unit,centrifugal pump prosection
                unit,Enginecomponent
</p><p style="margin: 15px;">
                These Equipment are used for tillage and showing equipments to save time and for higher production.
</p><p style="margin: 15px;">
                Metrology lab:- Metrology lab is one of the most important lab for mechanical engineering.Here
                mechanical parts are measured and prepared for different objectives.Here are various machines to make
                new mechanical parts and to test their efficiency.Some of the metrology lab machines are as follows:
</p><p style="margin: 15px;">
                Torsion testing machine:- With the help of this machine we can test the tension of the metal from which
                the mechanical part is made.
</p><p style="margin: 15px;">
                Hardness testing machine:-This machine is used to test the hardness of metal from which we are making
                parts of mechanical.
</p><p style="margin: 15px;">
                Profile projector:-This machine is used to check the projection of the mechanical part which determines
                the quality and efficeincy of the mechanical part.
</p><p style="margin: 15px;">
                Universal testing machine:-Universal machine is used to test the various qualities of material,which may
                be toughness,stuffness,torsion,tension and hardness.
