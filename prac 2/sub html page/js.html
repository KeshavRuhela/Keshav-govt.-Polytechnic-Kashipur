            JavaScript Language
        </h2>
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 15px;">
            JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
            ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It
            has
            curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 15px;">
            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] Over 97% of
            websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All
            major
            web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 15px;">
            As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
            styles.
            It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
            data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 15px;">
            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
            facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 15px;">
            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other
            software
            systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 15px;">
            Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective
            standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
